v0.7
CHANGES:
1) All rewards (HP, DEF and STR) are available through clearing rooms.
2) HP rewards grant you +3 HP each
3) The rewards are shuffled at random throughout the entire game, map by map.  The total rewards available by difficulty (HP/STR/DEF) are:
- Easy: 10/7/7
- Normal: 10/4/4
- Hard: 8/2/2 (max HP 35)
- Extreme: 6/0/0 (max HP 29)
4) You will now gain a reward for defeating Mummy Queen at the top of Babel Tower.  The rewards gathered by each boss are now as follows:
- Castoth: Underground Tunnel and Inca (no change)
- Viper: Diamond Mine and Sky Garden (no change)
- Vampires: Mu and Angel Dungeon
- Sand Fanger: Great Wall and Mt. Kress
- Mummy Queen: Pyramid
- Babel Tower: Ankor Wat
5) The captain of the Gold Ship can be found at the entrance to Inca Ruins.  If you have defeated Castoth, you can talk to him for instant passage to the Diamond Coast.

BUG FIXES:
- The special abilities for Will and Freedan now work correctly and independently.
- You might still get softlocked in Diamond Mine by attempting to rescue the trapped laborer with Slider or Spin -- however, logic has been updated such that Psycho Dash is required to acquire this item. Sequence break at your own risk.
- The bug that allowed you to remain as Freedan/Shadow out of Underground Tunnel has been fixed.
- The text box associated with the two items you get from the man in Dao now display the correct items.
- The bug where Vampires would not gather all their upgrades has been fixed.
- Spirits in Babel have been distributed to different floors, to allow warps if you cannot defeat bosses.
- Kara's portrait will now disappear when you use the Magic Dust on it.
- The Euro map glitch has been fixed.
- Itory elder has been fixed to always provide a spoiler.
- Dying to the Vampires in Mu sends you back one screen, instead of back to the beginning of the dungeon.
- When approaching the guard blocking the way from the Underground Tunnel, you no longer have to be against the top wall.
- Various NPC dialogue has been fixed.

v0.6
CHANGES:
- The randomizer is now run as a stand-alone executable with a GUI so users can generate their own seeds.
- The game now have four difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Extreme. The difficulty affects enemy stats, upgrades available, and how many HP are recovered from eating herbs.
- Room rewards are guaranteed to drop either a STR or DEF upgrade.  HP upgrades are available from beating bosses.  See the tutorial for more detailed information.
- The Dark Space in SW Sky Garden can now contain Dark Friar. (You can stand below the switch and reach it with Fredan's sword, so Dark Friar is not required to reach this Dark Space as was originally assumed.)
- Crystal Ring and Aura are now both required to enter Babel Tower.
- Dark Friar is now considered as required for progression through Mu.  This means the first Dark Space will always be open for transformation, and the other Dark Space will never contain Dark Friar.

KNOWN BUGS NOT YET ADDRESSED:
- Kara's portrait quest is complete when the Magic Dust is successfully used.  Kara's portrait will remain on the screen even after she is freed with the Magic Dust.  Leaving and reentering the room will provide visual confirmation that she has been freed -- however, this is unnecessary to complete the quest.
- When Kara's "portrait" appears in the Diamond Mine, she will look like her normal sprite instead of like the portrait itself. I hope to find a solution for this issue in future versions.
- Leaving the Jeweler's Mansion and immediately reentering via Dao causes the top layer to look strange.
- Acquiring Earthquaker still grants you Dark Friar
- Aura Barrier will not work unless you have Dark Friar


v0.5
CHANGES:
- Will now starts with standard health, defense, and strength.
- The number of total room-clearing status upgrades have been adjusted and shuffled throughout the maps in the game.  The number of health upgrades has remained the same from vanilla; the number of STR and DEF upgrades have been roughly halved.  This means that some rooms that normally give rewards will not give rewards; you can check the start screen to see if a room has a "force" or not.
- The enemies in the game have been rebalanced to reflect the loss in available upgrades and make the game more balanced. (NOTE: I do not guarantee that I found every enemy in the game, so if you find an enemy that seems wildly over-powered for its area, please make note of it if you can.)

KNOWN BUGS NOT YET ADDRESSED:
- Kara's portrait quest is complete when the Magic Dust is successfully used.  Kara's portrait will remain on the screen even after she is freed with the Magic Dust.  Leaving and reentering the room will provide visual confirmation that she has been freed -- however, this is unnecessary to complete the quest.
- When Kara's "portrait" appears in the Diamond Mine, she will look like her normal sprite instead of like the portrait itself. I hope to find a solution for this issue in future versions.
- Leaving the Jeweler's Mansion and immediately reentering via Dao causes the top layer to look strange.
- High STR might still destroy snakes in snake game (talk to NPC in front of the school to reset your STR/DEF)
- Acquiring Earthquaker still grants you Dark Friar
- Aura Barrier will not work unless you have Dark Friar



v0.4
CHANGES:
- The Kara Portrait quest is now functional (see below).
- The back of the Underground Tunnel is no longer accessible from Edward's Castle.  This means that the last two items in this area (the third chest and the Red Jewel pot behind the barrels) are only accessible by escaping Edward's Prison and progressing through the dungeon normally.
- Having Lilly with you after giving her the necklace is required to progress through the Underground Tunnel.
- Of the two Dark Spaces accessible in the Sky Garden (i.e. the save room in Area 2, or the bottom-side Dark Space in Area 4), one will always be available for switching.  (In other words, the Dark Space in the small save room might have an ability.)
- The man at the entrance of Dao now tells you which two items he gives you.
- The laborer in Freejia no longer gives a spoiler.
- The man at Diamond Coast now gives a spoiler.

KARA PORTRAIT QUEST:
Finding Kara's portrait and rescuing her with the Magic Dust is now necessary to complete the game.  The portrait will be randomized to appear at the end of one of the five minor dungeons.  Finding and reading Lance's Letter will spoil the location of Kara's portrait.  The portrait will appear in one of these locations:
- Underground Tunnel (north of where the Red Jewel is found behind the barrels)
- Diamond Mine (in the same room where Sam gives you an item)
- Angel Village (vanilla location)
- Mt. Kress (in the last room near the final chest)
- Ankor Wat (in the last room, on the wall to the right)

KNOWN BUGS NOT YET ADDRESSED:
- Kara's portrait quest is complete when the Magic Dust is successfully used.  Kara's portrait will remain on the screen even after she is freed with the Magic Dust.  Leaving and reentering the room will provide visual confirmation that she has been freed -- however, this is unnecessary to complete the quest.

- Aura Barrier will not work unless you have Dark Friar



v0.3
CHANGES:
- Inventory size constraints have been implemented in logic
- Logic bug that over-counted the number of Red Jewels acquired has been fixed
- Defeating the Vampires is now required to obtain Statue 3
- You can now access Castoth and Viper boss rooms after defeating them; this allows perpetual access to Gold Ship and Seaside Palace, respectively
- When entering Itory Village for the first time, you can move around a little before being sent back to the overworld
- Jeweler's Mansion logic has changed: 
  a) Exiting the mansion immediately sends you to Dao; 
  b) Defeating Solid Arm sends you to the top of Babel Tower and causes the spirit in Dao to appear as well
- Going to sleep on the Gold Ship (if you can manage to do it) sends you to the Diamond Coast
- Talking to Ishtar resets the puzzle in Angel Village
- Jackal should no longer soft lock you in Pyramid
- Euro guest room and Dao SE house are now able to be entered without hard-locking
- The bug that made the interior of Euro houses look strange has been fixed
- The issue that caused various NPCs to misbehave or disappear in late game (e.g. Erik, Lilly, etc.) has been fixed
- Wind Melody is now removed when Inca door is opened
- Opening sequence can be played fully without hard-locking
- In-game spoilers have been implemented (see below)
